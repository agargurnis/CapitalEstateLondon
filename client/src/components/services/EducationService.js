					The traditional education system in England is divided into four
					important parts:<br />
					<br />
					&ensp; &ensp; - Primary education, which the child receives from 5 to
					11 years.
					<br />
					<br />
					&ensp; &ensp; - Secondary education - secondary school education
					continues from 11 to 16 years. The last two years of training from 14
					to 16 years go to prepare for the GCSE exam, which corresponds to the
					receipt of the certificate of secondary education. Training can take
					place either in a public (free) school or in a private school, most of
					which also provide a boarding school.
					<br />
					<br />
					&ensp; &ensp; - Further education is the training under the Advanced
					Level program, which lasts 2 years and is designed for in-depth study
					of the basic subjects required for admission to the university.

					required to present an IELTS / TOEFL certificate.
