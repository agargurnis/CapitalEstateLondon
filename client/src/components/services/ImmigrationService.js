					Great Britain is a country that people of the whole world are always
					happy to choose for living.<br />
					<br />
					This is facilitated by the political and economic stability of
					Britain, a developed system of social guarantees, loyal attitude
					towards immigrants, an excellent system of education.<br />
					<br />
					The British passport is respected. The British themselves enjoy the
					right of visa-free entry into 180 countries located on all continents
					of the globe. There are no other such examples in the world.<br />
					<br />
					Another strong trump card in the UK is a convenient location. Flight
					by plane from Russia and other countries of Eastern Europe lasts about
					4 hours.<br />
					<br />
					It is also important that when you receive the citizenship of Great
					Britain, you are not deprived of citizenship of your current
					citizenship. In any case, unless otherwise provided by the laws of
					your country. In Russia, it is possible to obtain a second
					citizenship, under which all the rights and obligations of a citizen
					of the Russian Federation are preserved.<br />
					<br />
					The rights of a permanent resident in the UK can be obtained in
					several ways.<br />
					<br />
					After 5 years:<br />
					<br />
					&ensp; &ensp; - If you are a spouse or a regular business partner of a
					UK or EU citizen.<br />
					<br />
					&ensp; &ensp; - When staying in the country for professional
					immigration categories.<br />
					<br />
					After 10 years:<br />
					<br />
					&ensp; &ensp; - With legal residence in the UK during this period.<br />
					<br />

				<h4 className="text-center">How to become a resident</h4>
				<p className="pt-4">
					Buying and owning property in the UK does not give its owners the
					right to permanent residence.<br />
					<br />
					Therefore, the most attractive immigration programs in the UK, at the
					moment, are the Investor's visa and the Entrepreneur's Visa. They lead
					to a permanent residence permit (permanent residence), and then
					British citizenship for the whole family.
					<br />
					<br />
				</p>
				<h4 className="text-center">Investor's Visa</h4>
				<p className="pt-4">
					To obtain a residence permit under the Visa Investor program, it is
					required to invest at least £ 1 million in the UK economy.<br />
					<br />
					The Investor's Visa (Tier 1 Investor) is issued for the whole family,
					including children under 18 years of age.<br />
					<br />
					Initially, the visa is issued for 3 years with the subsequent
					extension for another 2 years. The applicant undertakes not to spend
					more than 180 days a year outside the UK. This is the only category
					for which there is no requirement for knowledge of English.<br />
					<br />
					Since 2011, the amount of investment for Investor Visa can be from 1
					to 10 million pounds sterling:<br />
					<br />
					&emsp; &emsp; £ 1 million - Permanent residence in 5 years and the
					citizenship of Great Britain in 6 years.<br />
					<br />
					&emsp; &emsp; £ 5 million - Permanent residence in 3 years and the
					citizenship of Great Britain in 5 years.<br />
					<br />
					&emsp; &emsp; £ 10 million - Permanent residence in 2 years and the
					citizenship of Great Britain after 5 years.<br />
					<br />
				</p>
				<h4 className="text-center">Entrepreneur's Visa</h4>
				<p className="pt-4">
					The Entrepreneur program assumes the opening (purchase) of his
					business, investing at least £ 200,000. It is also possible to open
					(buy) a business in the UK with a partner, where each contributes £
					100,000. Both partners and their families will have equal immigration
					rights to reside in the UK.<br />
					<br />Capital Estate London actively cooperates with first-class
					immigration lawyers who will be able to give more detailed advice on
					the possibilities of obtaining a residence permit in each specific
					case.
