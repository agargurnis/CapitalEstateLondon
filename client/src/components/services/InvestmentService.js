					England is first of all stability and reliability of investments.<br />
					<br />
					Despite the global recession, the prices for investment property in
					central London, according to the latest estimates of analysts, reached
					their pre-crisis peaks.
					<br />
					<br />
					So, for example, in 2011, prices for apartments in the area of
					​​Westminster increased by 10%.
					<br />
					<br />
					If you look at a more global picture - over the past two decades, the
					average price of real estate in England has increased almost 4 times.
					This is a capital increase of 400% in a developed country, despite all
					the crises experienced.
					<br />
					<br />
					In British real estate, as a rule, they invest for the purpose of
					preserving and increasing capital in the long term (10 years). But in
					the past two years we have seen unprecedented growth and so high
					rental prices - by 30% in London.
					<br />
					<br />
					A direct effect is the inflow of foreign investment, including from
					the CIS countries.
