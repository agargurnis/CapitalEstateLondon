					sought-after services provided by Capital Estate London.<br />
					<br />
					We cooperate with leading banks and brokers in the UK, which allows

					to study all the circumstances of the transaction. If there are no
					special conditions, then the average amount of a possible loan is the
					official annual income of the applicant, multiplied by three times.<br />

					For people who live in the UK, banks can offer loans up to 100 percent
					of the value of the property they purchase.<br />
					<br />

					size usually ranges from 90 to 95 percent.<br />
					<br />
					For non-residents, it is possible to get a loan in the amount of 65-70
					percent of the purchase price, taking into account the permanent place
					of residence and some other factors.

					to find the amount to deposit a security deposit that will cover the
					difference between the purchase price and the amount of the mortgage.

					from 2.5% to 4.5% per year.
