					The latest trend in the market - buyers are increasingly reliant on
					the taste of previous property owners in terms of interior design and
					go for his cardinal changes.<br />
					<br />
					This is understandable. Times change, tastes too.
					<br />
					<br />
					Capital Estate London cooperates fruitfully with leading London
					architects, interior designers who have an excellent reputation in
					their field of activity. After agreeing an indicative budget,
					designers begin to work, offering as a result to the client for
					consideration and approval of several projects developed by them.
					<br />
					<br />
					After choosing the option you like, the client communicates with the
					designers directly. However, at the request of the client, Capital
					Estate London employees will be able to participate in all subsequent
					meetings and negotiations.
					<br />
