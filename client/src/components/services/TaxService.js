					In England, as in any other country, there are standards of buying
					real estate, of which a foreign investor can only have an approximate
					idea.<br />
					<br />
					However, the questions that should be asked when buying a house or
					apartment are extremely important. One of them: "How is it better to
					place the acquired real estate - on a legal or physical person?".
					<br />
					<br />
					Many people are interested in the issue of transferring real estate to
					inheritance, as well as what taxes are paid on profits. Our advice is
					to entrust the solution of legal issues to professionals.
					<br />
					<br />
					Capital Estate London will gladly introduce you to our experienced
					partners, lawyers and tax specialists who will provide professional
					assistance in acquiring, registering real estate and resolving all tax
					issues.
					<br />
					<br />
					You should be prepared for the following mandatory expenses:
					<br />
					<br />
					1. Stamp Duty. This is the main tax on the purchase of real estate,
					which must be paid on the day the transaction ends. Since December 4,
					2014, the Stamp duty rate system in the UK has changed. Previously,
					this tax was calculated as a percentage of the value of real estate,
					depending on a certain group of rates.<br />
					<br />
					Now it is calculated by a simple progressive system, which looks like
					this:
					<br />
					<br />
					&emsp; &emsp; The first £ 125,000 - 0%
					<br />
					<br />
					&emsp; &emsp; from £ 125,000 to £ 250,000 - 2%
					<br />
					<br />
					&emsp; &emsp; from £ 250,001 to £ 925,000 - 5%
					<br />
					<br />
					&emsp; &emsp; from £ 925,001 to £ 1,500,000 - 10%
					<br />
					<br />
					&emsp; &emsp; over £ 1,500,000 - 12%
					<br />
					<br />
					Each interest rate will apply only to a portion of the value of the
					property falling within the appropriate range. over £ 2.000.000 for a
					legal entity - 15%
					<br />
					<br />
					2. Registration of the purchase in the Register is approximately 0.1%.
					<br />
					<br />
					3. Municipal tax for accommodation in the purchased and rented
					accommodation. Its size is about 100 pounds a month, depending on the
					area in which the property is located and its total area. All students
					are exempt from this tax.
					<br />
					<br />
					4. Other payments. These are administrative and registration fees,
					payment of brokerage services for mortgages and bank charges.
					<br />
